# Shopping Application
<br>
This shopping app helped me consolidate my knowledge of react-router, Links and hooks like useState, useEffect and useContext. 
<br>
Also learned to keep track of the fetching status and present either a loading or error status based on the response.
<br>
Lastly, I used CSS modules to locally style my components and routes, which helped keep the folder structure organized and readable.
<br>
Todo: Write tests for the app using vitest and React Testing Library.
