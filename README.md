# Shopping Application
<br>
This shopping app helped me consolidate my knowledge of React routers, links and hooks like useState and useEffect. 
<br>
Also learned to keep track of the fetching status and present either a loading or error status based on the response.
<br>
Lastly, I used CSS modules to locally style my components and routes, which helped keep the folder structure organized and readable.
